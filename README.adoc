= CORS test

Simple way to test CORS.

Based on https://medium.com/pareture/simple-local-cors-test-tool-544f108311c5[Nicks CORS Test], so go ahead to read more about it.

Code is almost the same as the code by Nick, except I added code to set cookies for servers that need authentication.

== Usage

* Edit link:cors-test.js[cors-test.js].
* Change `url` to the server you want to test.
* If the server requires authentication:
** authenticate with the server.
** add the session cookie to the code.
* Open link:index.html[index.html] with your browser.
* Check the console to see if CORS is enabled or not.
